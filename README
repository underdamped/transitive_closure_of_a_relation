warshall.c -- An implementation of Warshall's algorithm for computing the
              matrix of the transitive closure of a finite binary relation.

Usage:

Suppose you have a binary relation R on some finite set X, and you want to
find the matrix of its transitive closure.  Look no further!

Run the program and it will ask you for the first row of a boolean (zero-one)
matrix.  Enter the matrix of your relation row by row; the program will figure
out the size of your matrix after the first row is entered.

Once complete, you'll get a pretty-print of the matrix of R, including a
schematic of how R looks as a set on X = { a, b, c, d, ..., z }, followed
by a pretty-print of the matrix of R* (and its set schematic).
